## Description:
A simple QA automation test using using Selenium and Java on a demo eCommerce website.

**Test Site:** https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/

**Test Plan:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kdz-ZcEkzS5wWbFElhzfYRvwZ6nNUaQcqdPV4CYK03Q/edit?usp=sharing

## Reported Bugs:
**The "added to cart" alert occasionally doesn't appear:** 
- When running the "ItemSearch" and "PromoAdd" tests, they will occasionally fail.
- This is due to the tests not being able to move forward, as the alert will not load randomly.
